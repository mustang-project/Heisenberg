    IDL AND FORTRAN ROUTINES FOR APPLYING THE UNCERTAINTY PRINCIPLE OF 
               KRUIJSSEN & LONGMORE (2014), MNRAS 439, 3239
=========================================================================


Contents
========

KL14principle_F90: 
    The folder contains three files.
    - f_principle.f90: module containing functions for applying the uncertainty
      principle of Kruijssen & Longmore (2014).
    - test_principle.f90: example test program to apply the uncertainty
      principle for a single parameter set and aperture size.
    - This README.
    See the header of f_principle.f90 for a more detailed explanation.

KL14principle_IDL: 
    The folder contains two files.
    - f_principle.pro: contains functions for applying the uncertainty principle 
      of Kruijssen & Longmore (2014).
    - This README.
    See the header of f_principle.pro for a more detailed explanation.


Installation
============

Fortran:
    The functions are provided in a module and therefore cannot be used as
    stand-alone tools. In order to function properly, the module and its
    functions need to be called from the program they are used in. Example
    programs are provided in test_principle.f90. Part of these examples are also
    shown in the header of f_principle.f90.

IDL: 
    The function files need to be located in the working directory, or in some
    other location specified in your IDL_PATH. They can then be called as
    detailed in the headers of f_principle.pro.


Terms of Use
============

These routines are free software and come without any warranty. If you use these 
routines while preparing a paper or talk, the authors would appreciate it if you
cite the paper in which the uncertainty principle was presented:
Kruijssen J. M. D., Longmore S. N. 2014, MNRAS 439, 3239

If it is the first time you apply the uncertainty principle, the authors would
appreciate being involved in the project to provide assistance where necessary.
However, this is not required and you are free to use these routines as you see
fit.
         

Availability

Contact
=======

The routines have been thoroughly tested, but the possibility of bugs always
exists. If you have a question, comment, or suggestion, please feel free to
